Some important and commonly used functions of Vector class are:

1. begin() – Returns an iterator pointing to the first element in the vector.
2. end() – Returns an iterator pointing to the theoretical element that follows the last element in the vector.
3. size() – Returns the number of elements in the vector.
4. capacity() – Returns the size of the storage space currently allocated to the vector expressed as number of elements.
5. empty() – Returns whether the container is empty.
6. push_back() – It push the elements into a vector from the back.
7. pop_back() – It is used to pop or remove elements from a vector from the back.
8. insert() – It inserts new elements before the element at the specified position.
9. erase() – It is used to remove elements from a container from the specified position or range.
10. swap() – It is used to swap the contents of one vector with another vector of same type and size.
11. clear() – It is used to remove all the elements of the vector container.
12. emplace() – It extends the container by inserting new element at position.
13. emplace_back() – It is used to insert a new element into the vector container, the new element is added to the end of the vector.

//Removing element from a vector with element 0
for (auto i = p.begin(); i != p.end(); ++i) {
        if (*i == 0) {
            p.erase(i);
            i--;
        }
